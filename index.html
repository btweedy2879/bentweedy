  <h1>Ben Tweedy – Ministry Support</h1>

  <p>My name is Ben Tweedy. I’m preparing for vocational ministry and graduate theological training at Gateway Seminary. I currently serve at Grace Church in Chino Valley, Arizona, and later this spring my family and I will be relocating to the Phoenix area as we step into the next season of ministry and formation.</p>

<p>This page exists simply to provide clarity and transparency for those who have asked how to stay connected and how financial support is handled during this season. Many of the relationships surrounding this work are long-standing friendships shaped through shared church life, prayer, and ministry.

<p>Financial support given through Donorbox (processed securely via Stripe) is voluntary ministry partnership support. No goods, services, content, or benefits are provided in exchange for contributions. Funds help cover living expenses, theological training, and family needs so that I can give sustained attention to study, ministry, and family life without the pressures that often lead to burnout.</p>

<p>If you’ve landed here simply wanting to understand how this season is structured, I’m grateful for your care and interest.</p>
