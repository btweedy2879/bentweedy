  <h1>Ben Tweedy – Ministry Support</h1>

  <p>
    I am preparing for vocational ministry and graduate theological training at Gateway Seminary.
    I currently serve at Grace Church in Chino Valley, Arizona, and my family and I plan to relocate
    to the Phoenix area ahead of my Fall studies.

    This page exists to provide transparency regarding financial support received through Donorbox
    and Stripe. Contributions support ministry preparation, theological training, and family
    expenses during this transition season.
